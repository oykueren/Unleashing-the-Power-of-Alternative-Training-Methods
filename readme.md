# Unleashing the Power of Alternative Training Methods

## Abstract

The examination of neural network optimization strategies in this report focuses on the performance and applicability of numerous algorithms. We investigate the widely used stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent optimization methods. The genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing are other gradient-free techniques that we examine. We emphasize both the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy as we analyze them. We also look into the benefits of combining gradient-free and gradient-based neural network optimization methods. The study lays the foundation for future advancements in neural network optimization by revealing the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques.
